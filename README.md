- Hi, I’m @chmullens, Chris Mullens
- I’m interested in data! Analysis, statistics, visualization, you name it.
- I’m currently focusing on Python, SQL and applying machine learning techniques. 
- At some point, I'm going to get a multidimensional Kalman filter set up for a 
  pet project I've been working on with Steam community market data. It's been
  an interesting challenge getting 1D Kalman filtering working well with data
  that is irregularly spaced and distributed, but it does a fairly good job! The
  key to making it really effective will be taking into account signals from 
  related variables, using the multidimensional filter implementation. 
- You can reach me at chmullens@gmail.com, or chmullens on LinkedIn, etc.
