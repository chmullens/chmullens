- Hi, I’m Chris Mullens, @chmullens here and most other professional sites I'm on
- I’m interested in data! Analysis, statistics, visualization, and other tools.
- Currently focusing on Python, SQL, and applying machine learning techniques in Python.

Public repositories:
1. Names: Repository for the project "Hey, I know that name!", my capstone for Data Incubator Winter 2021. It focused on common names in the United States, from 1880 to the current day. The first part of the project is a tool to visualize names that are characteristic to a given year and age range; the second estimates future name popularity. This project uses US birth name and actuarial data, and involves data scraping, interpolation, feature engineering, data visualization in Matplotlib and Plotly, web APIs, affinity propagation clustering, and (currently) linear regression modeling for future name popularity estimations. 
2. Dice: This is a d20 dice tester to visualize whether dice are biased. It primarily uses Monte Carlo methods to estimate the likelihood that a given set of rolls comes from an unbiased dice, with an interactive dice visualization and face likelihood visualization. 
3. Covid tracking retrospective: This is a visualization of state-by-state data from the volunteer COVID Tracking Project, which provided the most comprehensive early-pandemic data available for the US and continued until May 2021. I used the data as a testbed for seeing what matplotlib can do, and as such there's a lot more info in the visualization than I would typically include. The final video file is included in the repository.
