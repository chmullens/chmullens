- Hi, I’m Chris Mullens, @chmullens here and any other professional sites I'm on
- I’m interested in data! Analysis, statistics, visualization, and other tools.
- I’m currently focusing on Python, SQL, R and applying machine learning techniques in Python and R. 
Current topics: 
1. Kalman filtering. I'm working on a multidimensional Kalman filter for Steam market data. It's a great test dataset for irregular sales data. A Kalman filter is one of the cleanest examples of a dynamic Bayesian network. You have a state, then you get new data, both of which have noise. Adding them together gives you a better state estimate, then you project forward (adding uncertainty) and update with a new measure (reduce uncertainty) repeatedly across time. Kalman filters are the optimal way to  predict the current state of a system under some assumptions, and 1D Kalman filtering is great to track single-item prices, even for irregularly-spaced data like I'm working with. Extending the filter to multiple dimensions, where I take into account many variables, is much less clear for prices than it is for, say, velocity vs. position! Even now, however, the 1D filter is doing a good job estimating true current prices.
2. Panel data regression for name tracking, great for modeling time series data with many variables. 
3. Recurrent neural networks (RNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM), additional great tools for tracking and predicting how data changes over time, for both names and market data.
